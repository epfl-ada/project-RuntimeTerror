# Building and analysis of movie arcs

Most plots in the film business follow one of a few well-known story arcs. For example, consider a narrative in which the main character begins in turmoil and finishes in bliss, or in which the main character resides happily but has problems that he/she must overcome before returning to his/her joy. In this project, we propose to explore this phenomenon in order to identify the most common storylines, how profitable those storylines are, and the evolution of the most prevalent storyline with time.

Research question: Which correlations can be retrieved from movie arcs?

Additional datasets: ? which ones?, if yes how to get, manage, process and enrich them

### Methods

We may create story arcs by performing sentiment analysis on each line of the plot and determining the positivity/negativity of the relevant scene. We propose clustering movies based on the similarities of their story arcs constructed from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset plots. With that, we can find the mean and variance of the revenue for each cluster, eventually leading to the identification of story arcs of the most profitable movie plots. Finally, we can repeat the same procedure but on a list of movie plots taken from different time frames hence resulting in a time series analysis of the evolution of the most prevalent story arcs.
